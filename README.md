*Refact.ai: Fine-tuned AI Coding Assistant*
Refact.ai is an open-source AI coding assistant that boosts developer's productivity. It's suitable for both individual and enterprise use, supporting 25+ programming languages including Python, Javascript, Java, Rust, Typescript, PHP, Java, C++, C#, Go and more.

Simplify your coding experience with Refact.ai's functions:

- **Code-completion:** helps you write code faster. It looks up and down from the cursor position in the current file, as well as other files in your project for context. After fine-tuning (available in Self-Hosting and Enterprise versions) a code completion model will provide you with more relevant suggestions: it can memorize your coding style, the right way to use your internal APIs, and the tech stack you use.
- **AI Toolbox:** helps explain, refactor your code, write documentation, find bugs, you can ask in natural language to generate new code for you. The Toolbox is customizable, you can create your own commands.
- **Integrated in-IDE Chat:** It's better than switching between IDE and a browser: select a piece of code in the editor, ask a question without the need to copy-paste anything, and apply changes back as a diff. Chat can either automatically include the relevant files within the project for context, or you can use @-commands to control what context to use to answer your question.
- **Self-hosting or cloud version:** enables you to host code completion and chat models yourself. The Refact.ai self-hosting server supports many recent models, offers efficient inference, and facilitates fine-tuning.
- **Access to 20+ LLMs:** (including Refact/1.6B, GPT-4, Code Llama, StarCoder2, Mistral, Mixtral, etc.) some of them with the opportunity to fine-tune.

- **Fine-Tuning:** We've solved all the complexity for you, no data engineer required. A fine-tuned code completion model will provide you with more relevant suggestions: it can memorize your coding style, the right way to use your internal APIs, and the tech stack you use. After fine-tuning, auto-completion helps our clients to write around 45% of their code.
